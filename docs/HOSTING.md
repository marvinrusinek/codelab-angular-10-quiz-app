If you know Angular and want to share your knowledge with other people in your home town, we would be happy to support you!

## How to host an event

To host an Angular Codelab 3 things are needed:

- A place to host the event (potentially in some local Angular company)
- Some way to invite people (local Angular or GDG meetup could help)
- At least one mentor who knows Angular and is familiar with Material.

The most important thing is to know Angular and to be interested to share your knowledge.
We can help with the rest.

A group of people gather together and starts going through the codelab with their own pace.
Organizes and volunteers are there to provide additional context and answer any outstanding questions.

❓How many people should I invite
There's no fixed size.
We have hosted successful events of 3-60 people. More is possible, but it might be harded to find space.

❓How long is it?
There are two formats:

- After work: starts about 6-7PM, and goes for 3 hours. Easier, but everybody's tired after work
- Weekend: starts in the morning, and goes for 3-5 hours. More productive, but takes part of your weekend
