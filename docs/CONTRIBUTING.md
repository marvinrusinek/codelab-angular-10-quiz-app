## Before You Start

### Code of Conduct

This project adheres to the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/).
So that everyone can feel welcome we ask you to please uphold this code should you decide to contribute to this project.

---

## Quick start

- `git clone https://github.com/codelab-fun/codelab.git` (this UTL might be different if you forked)
- `npm install`
- `npm start`

_Note:_
We use NPM as package manager, not Yarn.
Thus, please keep `package-lock.json` in sync with `package.json`, and do not commit `yarn.lock` file.

‚ö† `Windows` users may need to use `yarn` if `npm` fails

## Repository structure

We're using [NX](https://nx.dev/web) - Extensible Dev Tools for Monorepos.
This allows us to have multiple projects and libraries in one repository.

Most of the work will happen in `apps/codelab`, but here's the overview of the other folders:

```
- apps
  - codelab                  - The actual codelab code. Most of the work will be done here.
  - angular-thirty-seconds   - 30.codelab.fun code
  - kirjs                    - @kirjs's folder for experiments
  - lis                      - @the_kibs's folder for experiments
  - blog                     - blog is coming soon

- libs                       - Libraries and helper code shared across projects

- ng2ts                      - Legacy code which shouldn't be touched

- tools                      - Angular schematic for generating new presentations.
```

## Contributing to the Codelab

### Contributing Code

If you don't know where to start, try perusing issues marked by `help-wanted` tags!

If you want to work on something there isn't yet an issue for, consider submitting an issue so that multiple contributers aren't _unknowingly_ working on solving the same problem in parallel.

### Making a Pull Request

- Don't forget to pull from the master branch and resolve any merge conflicts first!
- We run `npm run lint && npm run build:prod && npm run format:check` in CI, so run it locally before committing you code
- If you don't have access to the repo, fork the project and make a PR from there
- Describe what the PR addresses
- Include screenshots and descriptive explanations if necessary

### Code Style

## Autoformatting

run `npm run format:write` before submitting your code.

# Linter

Angular Codelab comes with its own linter settings. If you're not sure your linter is picking up on them, please run `npm lint` and fix any styling errors before submitting.
