# Translating Codelab.fun

You can help us translate codelab.fun to other languages!

We're using online dashboard for seamless collaborative translation:

## How much work would it be?

We currently have about 500 translation terms, which amounts for a few days of work by one person.
the work can be easily parallelized and it's recommended, (but not required) to find couple more people (we can help spread the word).

Wording in the course is periodically updated, and it would be amazing if you could also help us periodically update translations.
